# App Engine

App Engine is a PaaS compute service that provides a managed platform for running applications.

## Features

- When you use `App Engine`, your focus is on your application and not on the VMs (`infrastructure`) that run the application.
- Instead of configuring VMs, you specify some basic resource requirements along with your application code, and Google will manage the resources needed to run the code.
- Users have less to manage, but also have less control over the compute resources that are used to execute the application.
- App Engine is created within a project.
