- A `single failure domain` within a region.
- Deploy `closer` to users for `optimal letency`.

## Region

- Regions are `independent geographic areas` that are `sub-divided into zones`.
- For `fault tolerance` and `high availability`.
- Intercommunication `<5ms between zones` within a region.

## Multi-Region
